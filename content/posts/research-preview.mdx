# Research Preview: AI-Driven Single-Cell Analysis

One of the core pillars of **01-Bio-Research** is the analysis of high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Today, we are sharing a preview of our automated analysis pipeline.

## The Challenge

Traditional scRNA-seq analysis involves multiple manual steps: quality control, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and annotation. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to bias.

## Our Approach: The Automated Pipeline

We have developed a Python-based pipeline leveraging **Scanpy** and custom AI models to streamline this workflow.

### Key Components

1.  **Preprocessing**: Automatic filtering of low-quality cells and normalization using pooled size factors.
2.  **Integration**: Batch effect correction using Harmony/BBKNN to merge datasets from different donors.
3.  **Diagnosis**: An AI module (`shawn_bot.bio`) that predicts cell types based on marker gene expression profiles.

```python
# Pseudo-code example of our pipeline
import scanpy as sc
from shawn_bot.bio import AutoAnnotator

def analyze_sample(adata):
    # Preprocessing
    sc.pp.normalize_total(adata)
    sc.pp.log1p(adata)
    
    # Dimension Reduction
    sc.tl.pca(adata)
    sc.pp.neighbors(adata)
    sc.tl.umap(adata)
    
    # AI Annotation
    annotator = AutoAnnotator(model='immune_v2')
    adata.obs['predicted_cell_type'] = annotator.predict(adata)
    
    return adata
```

## Future Work

We are currently validating this pipeline against manually annotated datasets. Initial results show a **95% concordance rate** in major cell type identification.

Full detailed reports and the source code will be available in the **Research** section soon.
